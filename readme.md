### 1. Why this project exists.

At my previous company we cound't find a CRM platform in the market that has much customizable. Even though we can create a custom property for our leads contact, it has no time stamp field for its change. This is a very disadvantages when it comes to data analysis, for example they want to know what lifecycle stage each lead went through, and when lead enter and leave those stages. I aim to develop an app to make this happen effortlessly by default.
